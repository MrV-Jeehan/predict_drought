# predict_drought
It uses multilayer perceptron for predicting SPI values.Wavelet transform is done to create features which tremendously increases the accuracy of model.Dataset ---North American dataset is taken from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/drought/nadm/indices .We predict the SPI values of last two months of every year with input input feature made from remaining 10 months.
